Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2021-01-17 23:23:14.
Deadlock reached.
The behavior up to this point is:
1: <Initial predicate>
/\ timeNoConsumer = 0
/\ conState = "connected"
/\ waitSet = {}
/\ queueBuffer = <<>>
2: <Next line 89, col 9 to line 92, col 36 of module ProducerConsumer>
/\ timeNoConsumer = 1
/\ conState = "!connected"
/\ waitSet = {}
/\ queueBuffer = <<p1>>
3: <Next line 89, col 9 to line 92, col 36 of module ProducerConsumer>
/\ timeNoConsumer = 2
/\ conState = "!connected"
/\ waitSet = {}
/\ queueBuffer = <<p1, p1>>
The coverage statistics at 2021-01-17 23:23:14

>>> We reach this deadlock with 1 producer, 1 consumer, a queue size of 2, and a queuettl of 2.
Even with a queuettl of 3, the system still has a trace indicating that the consumer thread did not have a chance to take anything out of the queue.

Changing the config to:
CONSTANTS
    Producer = {p1}
    Consumer = {c1} 
    QueueSize = 2
    QueueTTL = 4
makes the systems successful

Status
Checking ProducerConsumer.tla / ProducerConsumer.cfg
Success Fingerprint collision probability: 4.8E-18
